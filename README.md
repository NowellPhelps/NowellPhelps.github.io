Hello! I'm a Research Assistant in Epidemiology and Population Health at Imperial College London, as part of <a href="https://ncdrisc.org">NCD-RisC</a>, working on estimating trends in risk factors for non-communicable diseases using a Bayesian hierarchical model. 

I previously read Mathematics at the University of Oxford, where I took a range of pure, applied, and statistics courses. I ended up specialising in Network Science, Combinatorics and Mathematical Biology, and my Master's dissertation looked at an extension of the Voter Model to 3-uniform hypergraphs (modelling political polarisation/consensus outcomes in the context of interactions involving three agents). After finishing university, I was awarded a Summer Studentship at Oxford's Big Data Institute, where I looked at spatial metrics for schistosomiasis infection risk and contructing newtorks to investigate the spatial distribution of treatment. 

I am interested in Epidemiology, Networks and Complex Systems. Please get in touch if you have a project which you think could be a good fit!
