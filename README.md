Hello! I'm Nowell. 

I currently work as a research assistant for Professor Majid Ezzati at Imperial College London, as part of <a href="https://ncdrisc.org">NCD-RisC</a>, estimating trends in risk factors for non-communicable diseases using a Bayesian hierarchical model. I am leading an analysis updating our BMI and obesity estimates.

Before this I studied Mathematics at the University of Oxford, where I specialised in Network Science, Mathematical Biology, and Combinatorics. My Master's dissertation described and investigated a coevolutionary hypergraph model for political polarisation. I was awarded a Summer Studentship at the Big Data Institute, where I worked on constructing household-level metrics for schistosomiasis infection risk and investigated the spatial distribution of mass drug treatments. 

I'm broadly interested in using data-driven modelling to inform effective policies and interventions. Specifically, I'm currently interested in modelling the effects of climate changes and shocks on population health, using tools from complexity science and Bayesian statistics. Beyond academics, I'm an avid cyclist, climber, and reader.
