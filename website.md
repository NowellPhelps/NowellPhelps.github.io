## About
### 
Hello! I’m Nowell.

I currently work as a research assistant for Professor [Majid Ezzati](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/majid.ezzati) at Imperial College London, as part of [the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration](https://ncdrisc.org), estimating trends in risk factors for non-communicable diseases using a Bayesian hierarchical model. I am leading an analysis updating our BMI and obesity estimates.

Before this I studied Mathematics at the University of Oxford, where I specialised in Network Science, Mathematical Biology, and Combinatorics. My Master’s dissertation described and investigated a coevolutionary hypergraph model for opinion dynamics. At the end of my fourth year I was awarded a Summer Studentship at the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk), where I worked on constructing household-level metrics for schistosomiasis infection risk and investigating the spatial distribution of mass drug treatment. 
 
I’m broadly interested in using data-driven modelling to inform effective policymaking and interventions. More specifically, I hope to work on quantifying and predicting the effects of climate changes and shocks on population health. Beyond academics, I’m an avid cyclist, climber, and reader, and enjoy thinking about politics, migration, culture, and how science and public policy interact.

## Publications and projects

### Publications 
NCD Risk Factor Collaboration. [Diminishing benefits of urban living for children and adolescents’ growth and development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05772-8) Nature (2023).

### Projects
My [Master's dissertation](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qvvdfhvtkxpz) looked at opinion dynamics in the context of higher-order interactions, through proposing and investigating an extension of the coevolutionary network voter model to 3-uniform hypergraphs. 

Here's an essay [Predictive Computational Modelling for Epidemiology](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mxsrcscjnzsk), which I submitted as coursework for the Statistics Part C course Topics in Computational Biology, which I took for my master's. It gives an overview of common methods and challenges in modelling infectious disease outbreaks. 

[Stochastic block models and their use in node classification](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bcgbmybqyxby) looks at the use of SBMs in classifying nodes in networks according to their structural properties. I submitted this as coursework for the Mathematics Part C course Networks.

If you're bored (and with a friend) here's [a two player flash game I made in 2013](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10098205/).
