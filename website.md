## About
### 
I am a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. I am broadly interested in using data-driven modelling to inform effective and equitable policymaking and interventions, and am particularly interested in applications in international health.

I hold an MMath in Mathematics from the University of Oxford. After graduating I worked as a Research Assistant for Mazid Ezzati at Imperial College London; at ICL I led an analysis updating the World Health Organization's obesity estimates, and spent four months in Kigali, Rwanda as a visiting researcher at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences Research and Innovation Center.

Outside of academia, I'm an avid biker, climber and reader, and enjoy thinking about politics, culture, and how science and public policy interact.
