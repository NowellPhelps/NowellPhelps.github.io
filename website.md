## About
### 
I am a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. I am broadly interested in using data-driven modelling to inform effective and equitable policymaking and interventions. I am particularly interested in applications in international health.

I previously studied Mathematics at the University of Oxford. After graduating I worked as an RA in Epidemiology and Population Health at Imperial College London, where I lead an analysis updating the World Health Organization's global obesity estimates, and spent four months as a visiting researcher at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences Research and Innovation Center in Kigali, Rwanda.

Outside of academia, I'm an avid biker, climber and reader, and enjoy thinking about politics, culture, and how science and public policy interact.
