## About
### 
I am an incoming PhD candidate in biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. I am broadly interested in using data-driven modelling to inform effective policymaking and interventions, and am particularly interested in quantifying and predicting the effect of climate changes and shocks on population health.

I am currently working as a research assistant for [Majid Ezzati](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/majid.ezzati) at Imperial College London. I led an analysis updating the WHO's underweight and obesity estimates, and am currently in Kigali, Rwanda, as a visiting researcher at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences.

I hold an MMath in Mathematics from the University of Oxford, where I specialised in discrete mathematics and mathematical biology. My master’s dissertation described and investigated a coevolutionary hypergraph model for opinion dynamics. At the end of my fourth year I was awarded a summer studentship at the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk), where I worked on constructing household-level metrics for schistosomiasis infection risk and investigating the spatial distribution of mass drug treatment.

Beyond academics, I'm an avid cyclist, climber, and reader, and enjoy thinking about politics, culture, and how science and public policy interact.

## Publications and projects

### Publications
*First author* NCD Risk Factor Collaboration. [Worldwide trends in underweight and obesity from 1990 to 2022: a pooled analysis of 3663 population-representative studies with 222 million children, adolescents, and adults](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2823%2902750-2) The Lancet (2024).

NCD Risk Factor Collaboration. [Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02610-2) Nature Medicine (2023).

NCD Risk Factor Collaboration. [Diminishing benefits of urban living for children and adolescents’ growth and development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05772-8) Nature (2023).

### Projects
My [Master's dissertation](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qvvdfhvtkxpz) looked at opinion dynamics in the context of higher-order interactions, through proposing and investigating an extension of the coevolutionary network voter model to 3-uniform hypergraphs. 

I submitted the essay [Predictive computational modelling for epidemiology](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mxsrcscjnzsk) for the Statistics Part C course Topics in Computational Biology. It gives an overview of common methods and challenges in modelling infectious disease outbreaks. 

[Stochastic block models and their use in node classification](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bcgbmybqyxby) looks at the use of SBMs in classifying nodes in networks according to their structural properties. I submitted this as coursework for the Mathematics Part C course Networks.
